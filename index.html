            <p>Welcome to Ole Worm's Pavel Smerdyakov fansite, from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>.</p>

            <p>Smerdyakov is the landowner Fyodor Pavlovich's purported son with the beggar-woman Lizaveta. At the time of the events of the book, he has been integrated into the household as Fyodor Pavlovich's servant and cook. Though it would appear externally that he accepts his position, he resents his lack of acknowledgement and opportunity when compared to his half-brothers, whose social position is recognised as a result of their family name.</p>

            <p>Though he does not bear the name of Karamazov it is he who determines the trajectories of the remaining brothers, who replace him upon his death: Dmitri among the prisoners, condemned for the murder committed by Smerdyakov; Ivan in the madhouse; Alyosha the Revolutionary.</p>
