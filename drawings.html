            <p>It was 2021, the second complete year of the pandemic, when I was rereading <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>. But I wasn't doing it alone. My friend Bacchanalium and I were finding ways to pass the time and decided that we should read some books together to discuss. <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> ended up being one of our most enriching readings, though we chose it at the beginning because it was public domain and we wouldn't have to buy it in order to have access to it :^></p>

            <p>During the time that we were reading and for some time after Bacchanalium made some lovely drawings of the characters, which they've asked me to post. So far, all of them date to 2021.</p>

            <p>These drawings first appeared on my <a href="https://oleworm.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, under <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> <a href="https://oleworm.tumblr.com/tagged/the%20brothers%20karamazov">tag</a>. Permission has been granted to repost here.</p>
