            <p>It was 2021, the second full year of the pandemic, that I decided to reread <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>. But I wasn't going to do it all on my own. My friend Bacchanalium and I were looking for ways to pass the time, and reading and discussing books together was one of those things. <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> ended up being one of our favourite and more enriching reads, though we chose it at the beginning because it was public domain and we wouldn't have to buy it in order to have access to it :^></p>

            <p>During the time that we were reading and for some time after Bacchanalium made some brilliant drawings of the characters, which they've asked me to post. So far, all of them date to 2021.</p>
